# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## My first on-the-job ticket summary



**Assignment** I have been hired to refactor an existing site in order to make it more accessible. This entailed analyzing the html file and replacing structural elements with semantic elements and implementing those changes to correspond with the css styesheet.

Structural <div> elements in the htmnl were replaced with <aricle>, <aside>, and <footer> semantics dependent upon the the type of content and positioning within the body.

After reviewing the css, there were various classes with repeating syntaxes. To resolve this and clean up the css, classes sharing the same syntaxes were consolidated onto the sameline

This work was completed following the *Scouts Code*, by optimizing the site without drastically changing the foundation of the files provided.

Additionally, this work was based off of the below *Acceptance Criteria*

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
